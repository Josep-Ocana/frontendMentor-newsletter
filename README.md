## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I've worked with forms in js and alert messages.

I established knowledge about write js code in separate files to do easy the maintenance of my projects.

-   In my CSS code I use _classes_ to do styles both containers and so I use less code. and then change one of them if I need it using _id_.

```css
.container {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row-reverse;
	justify-content: space-between;
	gap: 3rem;
	max-width: 56.7rem;
	padding: 24px;
	border-radius: 2rem;
	background-color: var(--white);
}
... #success-container {
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: center;
	gap: 0;
	max-width: 30rem;
	padding: 3.5rem;
}
```

-   In Js I've used expression IIFE to protect variables.

```js
(function () {
	...
    const formEmail = document.querySelector('#form');
	formEmail.addEventListener('submit', validateForm);
})();
```

### Continued development

I want to focus in the three pillars for building web pages: CSS, HTML, and JS and I want to start learnig REACT soon to do my webs more efficient and with reusable code.

### Useful resources

-   [Chat GPT](https://www.example.com) - I use this tool for two reasons: first I find what I am looking for, and second I am learning how use it because it is going to be essential tool in our future.
